## Getting Started 
1. Simply open `index.html` in your browser or visit the deployed version.
2. Install JSON Server - npm install -g json-server
3. Run the JSON Server - json-server --watch db.json or (json-server --watch db.json --port 3000)
        |_Server will start at : http://localhost:3000/

## Architecture

- Feature-based structure – Each module (Admin/Customer) is self-contained
- JSON Server – Simulates backend  with db.json
- Tailwind CSS – For fast, responsive, and modern UI styling
- HTML + JS Modules – Keeps business logic separate for each feature
